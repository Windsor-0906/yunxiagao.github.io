        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Yunxia GAO, I'm from Beijing, the capital of China. I worked as an <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr> professional in China for 10 years.This is 1<sup>th</sup> year that I have been in Canada. My favorite sport is badminton. The exhilarating feeling it gives me makes me feel completely relaxed. Additionally, I also enjoy photography. I hope to capture the beautiful moments around me through the lens, and I especially love documenting my daughter's growth.</p>

        <p>In fact, studying Interactive Media Design is truly challenging for me. Not only do I have no prior experience in design or coding, but I also need to take care of my 4-month-old daughter, which consumes a lot of my time and energy. However, I am really passionate about this field, and I need to learn a skill that will serve as a foundation for finding a job and staying in Canada. <blockquote>The only way to do great work is to love what you do. --<cite>Steve Jobs</cite></blockquote>
        <br>
        Although life is not easy for me right now, I still remain hopeful. <em>I believe that the challenges are temporary, and everything will gradually get better.</em>
